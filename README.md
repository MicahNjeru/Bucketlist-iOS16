#  Bucketlist iOS 16
## About this app
- This app lets users add a private list of places on the map that they'd want to visit one day
- Users can add a description of the place, look up other places nearby
- All this data can then be saved securely on the user's device
- Data saved can be backed-up into `iCloud`

## What I've learned
How to:
1. Use forms, sheets, `Codable` protocol and `URLSession` 
2. Embed maps in a SwiftUI app 
3. Store data privately and securely such that only authenticated users can access it
4. Load and save the data outside of `UserDefaults`
